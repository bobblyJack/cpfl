 /* ok this is what it needs to do
    render a dashboard!
    the dash you can reach by clicking on the page name
    or maybe just a home button to the left of the page name
    when you're on the dash, the app nav buttons are the page content
    and the header displays a nice welcome message
    when you're on a page, the app nav shows you the buttons
