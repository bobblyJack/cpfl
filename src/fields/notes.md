things that should go here:
basically anything that can/should go in a form
so, obviously inputs
select elements also for dropdowns, with option elements and optgroups
buttons for better button controls (should maybe be its own module given use outside of forms also)
fieldsets with legends
textarea for multi-line thingos

output element ?
meter / progress elements for display purposes ?? they dont go in forms inherently but could consider.
no, keep it to just user input elements (beyond literally input)

## labels
need to either contain the element they are for
or use "for" attribute = element_id
can also use "form" attribute = form_id but probably not needed.
