to do:
- finish initial auth set up
- worry about fallback later just try sso for now
- make sure i haven't broken anything
- add fallback auth through msal-browser
- once auth is working add some admin controls that show up if i am logged in
- add a console to the taskpane which can display non-admin messages for non-me's
- fetch a precedent template, maybe start with the letterhead
- consider looking into react for UI
