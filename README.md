# WIP
create basic UI
use app folder also to cache partially finished files
change login style from popup to redirect ?
    or just add as fallback state in case popup is blocked

I could literally implement Actionstep's API ??? Needs API Credentials though.
Alternatively, perhaps accept an export of data from AS to start the client file ?

# icons
iconify-icon ? the carbon set looked ok.
imports as a dependency and then can be bundled.
seems decent.
i do need to think UI at some point.

## idea
migrate balance sheet into app ?
    would require access to actionstep data ? maybe not. just names i guess ?
    could key a file id in and save stuff locally based on that ?

# production steps - to do when publishing
- change app ID URI to prod host
- if ever deployed on different tenant, they can change config.json to their values
