IndexedDB's default behavior is **persistent** by design. This means that when you create and use an IndexedDB database, the data will **persist** between sessions (i.e., when you close and reopen the browser, or refresh the page). You do **not need to explicitly tell IndexedDB to save the data** — the data is automatically stored by the browser, and it survives across sessions unless you explicitly delete it.

Here's how it works:

### Default Behavior of IndexedDB:
- When you create a database and store data in it using IndexedDB, the data is saved on the user's local disk (or equivalent storage, depending on the browser and platform). It **persists across sessions**, even if the user closes the browser or restarts their computer.
- The database is **tied to the specific browser**, meaning it will persist across tabs and browser sessions in the same browser on the same machine.
- **No explicit action** is required to keep the data; it is stored automatically as you add, update, or delete entries in your object stores.

### When Does IndexedDB Data Persist?

- The data in IndexedDB persists unless explicitly deleted by the application (using methods like `deleteDatabase()` or `clear()` on object stores).
- Data will also persist even after you close or reopen the browser or the computer.
- The data is stored in **browser storage**, typically in a specific location on the file system managed by the browser (e.g., in the browser profile or user data directory).

### When Might Data Not Persist?

There are a few scenarios in which IndexedDB data may not persist:
1. **Private Browsing / Incognito Mode**: Browsers typically do not persist any data in IndexedDB when the user is in private browsing or incognito mode. Once the session ends, the data will be cleared automatically.
2. **Browser Storage Limits**: Browsers have limits on how much data can be stored using IndexedDB. If the browser exceeds its storage limit, it might delete data (or prevent further storage), depending on the browser's implementation.
3. **Manual Deletion**: If your app uses `indexedDB.deleteDatabase()` to delete the database or you use `clear()` or `delete()` on object stores to remove data, that will explicitly delete the data.

### Does IndexedDB Require Explicit Saving?

No, **you do not need to explicitly tell IndexedDB to save data**. IndexedDB will automatically persist the data you put into it as long as the browser session persists. This means that:
- If you store data in IndexedDB through a transaction, that data will be saved and available for the next session.
- IndexedDB is **automatically persistent** unless you take actions to delete the database or remove data.

### Managing IndexedDB Persistence

If you want to **control when the data is deleted or expire**, you will need to manually manage this. For example:
- If you only want to store temporary data during a session, you could delete the database or clear object stores at the end of the session.
- You can also use **expiration logic** (e.g., storing a timestamp for the last access time) and delete data after a certain time.

### Example: Automatically Deleting Data After Session

If you want to delete the data when the session ends, you would need to manually handle it (though browsers don't natively clear IndexedDB on session end unless in incognito/private mode).

Here's an example where you might clear data after a session:

```javascript
// Opening IndexedDB
const request = indexedDB.open('myDatabase', 1);

// Handle the onupgradeneeded event to set up the database schema
request.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
  const db = event.target.result;
  if (!db.objectStoreNames.contains('contacts')) {
    const objectStore = db.createObjectStore('contacts', { keyPath: 'id' });
    objectStore.createIndex('name', 'name', { unique: false });
  }
};

// After success, you can clear data when needed
request.onsuccess = function(event) {
  const db = event.target.result;

  // Add a cleanup function when the session ends (could be tied to window or tab close)
  window.onbeforeunload = function() {
    // Clearing the data
    const transaction = db.transaction('contacts', 'readwrite');
    const objectStore = transaction.objectStore('contacts');
    objectStore.clear();  // Clears all data in the 'contacts' object store
  };
};
```

In this example, we listen for the `onbeforeunload` event (which fires when the user is about to leave the page) and clear the data from the object store before the session ends.

### Conclusion:
- **IndexedDB is persistent by default**: Data stored in IndexedDB will remain until the user or the app explicitly deletes it, even if the browser is closed and reopened.
- **No explicit save operation** is needed — it handles persistence automatically.
- If you need the data to only persist during a session (or until the browser is closed), you would need to manually clear it or implement a session expiration policy. Otherwise, the data will persist until you delete it.
