To track changes in files and folders on a Microsoft Graph drive, you can utilize several strategies that Microsoft Graph provides. While there isn't a single hash for an entire drive or folder that indicates changes, you can effectively monitor changes by leveraging the following methods:

### 1. **Using Change Tracking with `delta` Queries**
Microsoft Graph provides a `delta` query capability that allows you to track changes in a user's OneDrive or SharePoint drive. You can use this to monitor additions, deletions, and updates of files and folders.

#### How it Works:
- When you first call the delta endpoint, it will return the current state of the items in the drive and provide a **delta token** in the response.
- Store this delta token for subsequent requests.
- On subsequent calls, you can use this token to retrieve only the changes since your last request.

#### Example Request:
```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive/root/delta
```

#### Response:
The response will include:
- Added items
- Deleted items (marked with a deletion flag)
- Updated items

### Example for Using Delta Queries:
1. **Initial Call**: Retrieve the current state of the drive and store the delta token.
2. **Subsequent Calls**: Use the stored delta token to check for changes.
3. **Handling Changes**: When changes are detected (e.g., a new file is added), you can then re-map your local representation as needed.

### 2. **Etag for Files and Folders**
Each file and folder in OneDrive/SharePoint has an **ETag** (Entity Tag) associated with it. The ETag is a unique identifier that changes whenever the file or folder is modified. You can store the ETag locally and compare it during subsequent requests to see if the metadata has changed.

#### Example Request:
When you retrieve a file or folder, the ETag is included in the response:
```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive/items/{item-id}
```

#### Example Response:
```json
{
  "id": "file-id",
  "name": "example.docx",
  "eTag": "12345",
  ...
}
```

#### Using ETags:
- Store the ETag for each file/folder.
- Before accessing a file/folder, re-fetch its metadata and compare the ETag.
- If the ETag has changed, that indicates the file or folder has been modified and you may need to re-map.

### 3. **File System Notifications (Webhooks)**
If your add-in runs in a context where you can listen for changes, you might consider implementing webhooks. Microsoft Graph supports subscriptions to changes in resources, including files and folders.

#### Steps:
1. Create a subscription to changes in the drive or specific folders.
2. Microsoft Graph will send notifications to your specified endpoint when changes occur (like additions, deletions, or modifications).
3. Upon receiving a notification, you can trigger your logic to refresh your local mapping.

#### Example Request for Subscribing to Changes:
```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "created, updated, deleted",
  "notificationUrl": "https://yourapp.com/notifications",
  "resource": "/me/drive/root",
  "expirationDateTime": "2024-10-04T18:23:45.9356913Z"
}
```

### 4. **Periodic Polling**
If real-time updates aren't critical, you can implement periodic polling:
- Set a timer to regularly check for changes by calling the `delta` endpoint or re-fetching folder metadata and comparing ETags.
- This approach is simpler but may result in unnecessary requests.

### Summary
To monitor changes in a Microsoft Graph drive effectively:
- Use **delta queries** to track changes incrementally and obtain a delta token.
- Utilize **ETags** to check if specific files or folders have been modified.
- Consider using **webhooks** for real-time notifications about changes.
- Optionally, implement **periodic polling** if real-time updates are not necessary.

These strategies will allow your Office Add-in to keep track of changes in the drive and maintain an up-to-date local representation without requiring excessive resource use.
